    <h1>A. P. J. Abdul Kalam</h1>
    <h4>Introduction</h4>
    <p>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam BR 15 October 1931  27 July 2015 was an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007. 
        He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, 
        mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts. 
        He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology. 
        
    <h4>Early life and education</h4>
    <p>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to a Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island,
         then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of Tamil Nadu. His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque; 
         his mother Ashiamma was a housewife. His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi.</p>
    
    <h4>Career as a scientist</h4>
    <p>After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, 
        Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation 
        (by Press Information Bureau, Government of India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS). 
        He started his career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO. Kalam joined the INCOSPAR, 
        working under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist. He was interviewed and recruited into ISRO by H. G. S. Murthy, 
        the first Director of Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station (TERLS).

    <h4>Presidency</h4>
    <p>Kalam served as the 11th president of India, succeeding K. R. Narayanan. He won the 2002 presidential election with an electoral vote of 922,884, 
        surpassing the 107,366 votes won by Lakshmi Sahgal. His term lasted from 25 July 2002, to 25 July 2007.</p>

    <h5>Death</h5>
    <p>On 27 July 2015, Kalam travelled to Shillong to deliver a lecture on "Creating a Livable Planet Earth" at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong. 
        While climbing a flight of stairs, he experienced some discomfort, but was able to enter the auditorium after a brief rest. 
        At around 6:35 p.m. IST, only five minutes into his lecture, he collapsed.
         He was rushed to the nearby Bethany Hospital in a critical condition; upon arrival, he lacked a pulse or any other signs of life. 
         Despite being placed in the intensive care unit, Kalam was confirmed dead of a sudden cardiac arrest at 7:45 p.m. IST. His last words, 
         to his aide Srijan Pal Singh, were reportedly: "Funny guy! Are you doing well?"</p>
